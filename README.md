## Architecture

```
Browser (SPA)  ── localStorage ──────────────────────────────────────
    │   expenses · personalised centroids · overrides · settings
    │
    │  HTTP/JSON  +  WebSocket (audio)
    ▼
Flask backend  (app.py)
    ├── services/classifier.py
    │     • SentenceTransformer (paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2)
    │     • Nearest-centroid + cosine similarity
    │     • Online (incremental) centroid updates
    ├── services/receipt.py   ── Gemini 2.5 Flash       (receipt OCR → JSON)
    ├── services/voice.py     ── Gemini 2.5 Flash       (voice → function call)
    └── /ws/voice_live        ── Gemini Live API        (streaming transcription)
    +   Frankfurter API (FX rates)  ·  Google Places API (location autocomplete)
```

The server is **stateless with respect to user data**. Expenses, personalised centroids, and overrides all live in the browser's `localStorage`. The server only ships a read-only *base model* (`dataset/centroids.json`) that new clients download on first run, after which every classify/learn request carries the client's own centroids.

---

## Processes

### 1. Server Startup

1. The `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` SentenceTransformer model is loaded into memory.
2. If `dataset/centroids.json` exists, base centroids and overrides are loaded from it.
3. Otherwise, if `dataset/monthly_spending_2024.csv` exists, base centroids are computed (merchant names → embeddings → per-category mean vectors) and saved to JSON.
4. Otherwise the classifier starts empty (every merchant falls through to "Others").

### 2. Manual Expense Entry

1. User types a **merchant name** and leaves the field — the client posts its own centroids to `POST /api/classify`.
2. The server embeds the name, computes cosine similarity against the **client-supplied** centroids, and returns a prediction, confidence (0–1), top-3 candidates, and `needs_review` flag.
3. If confidence is below `ASK_BELOW = 0.6`, the frontend highlights the category selector for manual confirmation.
4. User fills in amount, currency (with live FX conversion if not the default), date, category, payment method, optional notes, and optional location.
5. On submit, `POST /api/learn` updates the user's local centroid (returned in the response and re-saved to `localStorage`), then the expense is persisted to `localStorage`.

### 3. Receipt Scanning

1. User takes a photo or drops an image into the **Add** view.
2. `POST /api/scan_receipt` sends the image (multipart/form-data) to the server, which calls Gemini via Vertex AI.
3. The server forwards the image to **Gemini 2.5 Flash** with a structured prompt that requests a strict JSON receipt schema.
4. Gemini returns extracted fields (merchant, date, total, currency, payment method, line items, notes). Missing date defaults to today.
5. The extracted merchant is classified by the same ML pipeline.
6. Pre-filled form fields are shown for user confirmation before saving.

### 4. Voice Input

There are two voice flows; the client picks one based on browser capability:

- **Streaming live transcription** (`/ws/voice_live`) — the browser streams 16 kHz PCM audio over a WebSocket. The server opens a Gemini Live session and relays incremental input transcripts back to the browser for a live subtitle.
- **Batch processing** (`POST /api/voice_input`) — after recording, the audio blob is uploaded; Gemini 2.5 Flash is called with an `add_expense` **function declaration** and extracts merchant, total, currency, date, payment method, notes, and individual items via function calling.

The extracted merchant runs through the classifier identically to a receipt scan.

### 5. Online ML Learning (client-personalised)

Each `POST /api/learn` carries the client's current centroids/overrides:

1. The embedding for the merchant is taken from a per-request cache (populated by the prior `/api/classify`), or recomputed.
2. The category's centroid is updated with an **incremental running average**:
   ```
   new_centroid = (old_centroid · n + embedding) / (n + 1)
   ```
   The result is L2-normalised and `n` is incremented.
3. If the user **corrected** the predicted category, the lowercased merchant name is added to `overrides` — future classifications of that exact name return the corrected category with confidence 1.0. (Centroid updates are skipped when an override already covers the merchant.)
4. The updated `{categories, overrides}` payload is returned and written back to `localStorage` under `flo_centroids`.

### 6. Location Autocomplete

When `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is set in the environment, the Add / Edit forms load the Google Maps JS SDK and offer:

- **Near me** — uses `navigator.geolocation` + Places `nearbySearch` to list nearby establishments.
- **Type-ahead** — debounced `textSearch` biased to the cached position.

### 7. Currency Conversion

The home/summary views aggregate across multi-currency expenses. The frontend fetches rates via `GET /api/exchange_rates?base=<DEFAULT>`, which proxies the [Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app) API. Rates are cached in `localStorage` per base currency.

## Data Stored

### Server — `dataset/centroids.json`

The shared base model used to bootstrap new clients. After bootstrap, each browser maintains its own copy under `flo_centroids`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | string | SentenceTransformer model name |
| `threshold` | float | Minimum cosine similarity to assign a category (below → "Others") |
| `categories` | object | Map of category name → `{centroid: float[], n: int}` |
| `categories[*].centroid` | float[] | 768-dimensional normalised mean embedding vector |
| `categories[*].n` | int | Number of training examples that built this centroid |
| `overrides` | object | Map of lowercased merchant name → category string (exact-match shortcuts) |

**Built-in categories:** Banking & Fees, Entertainment & Subscriptions, Food & Beverage, Groceries, Health & Wellness, Home & Living, Personal Care, Pet Supplies, Shopping, Transport, Others.

## Setup & Running

Dependencies are declared in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) (conda + pip).

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gen_ai
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. All AI features run through **Vertex AI** — no Google API key string is needed.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | **Yes** | Your GCP project ID. Enables receipt scanning, voice input, and AI spending insights. |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` | No | Vertex AI region. Defaults to `us-central1`. |
| `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` | No | Google Maps Platform key (`AIza…`). Enables location autocomplete in the Add/Edit form. Without it, the location field is a plain text input. |
| `REQUIRE_PASSWORD` | No | Set to `true` (default) to protect the app with a password, or `false` to leave it open. |
| `APP_PASSWORD` | No | The password shown on the login page. Only used when `REQUIRE_PASSWORD=true`. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | No | Signs the session cookie. Generate with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`. A new random key is generated on each restart if not set (this logs everyone out on server restart). |

Example `.env`:

```bash
# Required
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id

# Optional
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=AIza...

# Access control
REQUIRE_PASSWORD=true
APP_PASSWORD=your-secret-password
SECRET_KEY=your-random-hex-string
```

### Authentication

Gemini calls go through **Vertex AI** and use Google's [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) — no API key required.

**Local development** — run once after installing the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install):

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

This saves credentials to `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`. The SDK picks them up automatically on every subsequent run.

**GCP deployment (Cloud Run, GKE, Compute Engine, etc.)** — credentials are provided automatically by the compute metadata server. No extra setup needed beyond ensuring the service account has the **Vertex AI User** role (`roles/aiplatform.user`) and the Vertex AI API is enabled in your project:

```bash
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### Share over a tunnel

[`run_and_share.sh`](run_and_share.sh) starts the app, exposes it through a public tunnel, and prints a QR code for quick mobile access:

```bash
./run_and_share.sh
```

By default it uses [`lt`](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) with a fixed subdomain, giving a **stable URL** (`https://myfloapp-tum.loca.lt`) across runs. Override the subdomain with `LT_SUBDOMAIN`, or switch to a [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-tunnel/) quick tunnel (no reminder page, but a **random URL** each run) with `TUNNEL=cloudflared`:

```bash
LT_SUBDOMAIN=my-custom-name ./run_and_share.sh   # fixed lt URL
TUNNEL=cloudflared ./run_and_share.sh            # random, no reminder page
```

Requires one of those tunnel tools plus one of `qrencode` / Python `qrcode` on `PATH`.

> With `lt`, browser visitors may see localtunnel's reminder page once per public IP (every 7 days). Programmatic callers can bypass it with a `bypass-tunnel-reminder` request header (any value) or a non-standard `User-Agent`. Those are request headers, so they don't help a fresh browser navigation — use `TUNNEL=cloudflared` to avoid the page entirely (at the cost of a fixed URL).

### Data Export / Import

From the **Settings** view:

- **Export JSON** — downloads `flo-expenses-YYYY-MM-DD.json` (full expense array).
- **Export CSV** — downloads `flo-expenses-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`.
- **Import JSON** — merges a previously exported JSON backup into `localStorage`, skipping duplicate IDs.
- **Reset to Base Model** — discards the browser's personalised centroids and re-downloads the server's base model.
